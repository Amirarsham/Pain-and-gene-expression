Codes and design files used in Biology Honours research


Project title: Effect of noxious stimuli( sub-lethal electric shocks) on the expression of PTH2 gene in Danio rerio



Lab: Erickson's Lab

Faculty of Biology, University of New Brunswick

Creator: Amirarsham Farahmand


3D files were created in Fusion 360

3D files are available in 3D_Design folder

Main code and diagram of electrical connection used for the setup on a Arduino Mega is availabe in Final_Shocking_cycle_code folder

Code, data set, histogram for the random normally generated shocking and resting intevals are availabe at Cycle_Generation folder

Experiment_code_decoder.py is the code for decoding the "Experiment Code" to reveal the groups(Experiment code makes it double blind)
